THIS IS PRE-RELEASE INFORMATION AND MAY CHANGE BEFORE RELEASE

Make a complete backup (including database), delete /edit, any /Templates folders, drop upgrade files and recompile your solution.

Breaking changes:
- .NET 3.5 (or greater) is now required
- N2.Web.HtmlHelper is now deprecated and renamed to FormsHelper (to avoid conflicts with MVC)
- Adapters are not decorated with [Adapts] attribute rather than [Controls]
- Management interface is moved from /edit to /n2/content
