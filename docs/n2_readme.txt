anyone can update. Web content editors will enjoy a simple and enpowering web 
interface while developers can benefit from a discoverable and programmer 
friendly API.

GETTING STARTED

The easiest option is probably downloading the examples. Either templates 
implementation example for more fluff or the simple example to get the bare 
bones.


INSTALLATION

* see install.txt


TEMPLATES

The templates is a set of out of the CMS functionality. Use this if you want 
the most common features quickly. Open src\N2_Everything-vs2008.sln to view the
code or src\Examples\TemplatesImplementation\MyProject-vs200[5|8].sln.


EXAMPLES

There are a bunch of examples in the Examples "examples" directory of the 
source code package. To run them you need to copy the compiled output of the
core project and the edit interface into the example's web roots. 
Prepare_Dependencies-vs2008.bat should do this for you. The examples:

* MediumTrust: How to run N2 in a medium trust environment (favoured by many 
  shared hosting providers).
* Mvc: Integration with the ASP.NET MVC framework
* Parts: Bare minimum project using "parts", i.e. drag'n'drop components on a 
  page.
* MinimalVisualBasic: Very simple web site in Visual Basic. This project includes
  the least amount of noise for grasping the basic model.
* MinimalCSharp: Very simple web site in C#. This project includes the least 
  amount of noise for grasping the basic model.
* TemplatesSite: A proposed approach at integrating with the templates project.
