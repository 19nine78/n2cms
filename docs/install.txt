- compile and run the application
- browse to /edit/install (use admin/admin to log in)
- follow the instructions on the installation page (also below)
	- Create an empty database in your server of choice. 
	- Update the connection string in web.config, head to /edit/install/ConfigurationExamples.aspx for examples
	- If you can't use the web interface for installation you can find create database scripts  below the folder N2.Installation\SqlScripts below in the N2 solution
	- Now you need to insert the first node, I recomend using the installation page for this
	- IMPORTANT! Change the default password in web.config. If you've installed, configured and created an administrator account using a membership provider, comment out this section entirely.
