
DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT

Follow these steps to get started with in a development environment depending 
on the download type you picked.

A. Templates or example package

* Unzip the package
* Find a solution file (.sln) in a sub-directory and open it
* Compile and run the application (Ctrl+F5)
* A browser starts, and you can manage content via /n2/

B. Complete Sources package

* Unzip the package
* Find a batch file "Prepare_Dependencies.bat" and double-click
* Open "src\N2.Sources-vs2008.sln"
* Right-click on the N2.Templates.Mvc (or N2.Templates for WebForms) project 
  and set it as "Set it as StartUp Project"
* Compile and run the application (Ctrl+F5)
* A browser starts, and you can manage content via /n2/



SERVER ENVIRONMENT

The development environment is set up to use SQLite embedded database engine.
In production MySQL or SQL Server are better choices.

* Open your project in Visual Studio
* Right-click on the web application project and select "Publish..."
* Publish to a local directory
* Go to this directory and copy the N2 management files to it. These files can 
  be downloaded separately and most of them resize below the /N2/ subdirectory
* Open web.config in the local directory and:
  * update the connection string
  * change the "admin" password to something really hard to figure out
* Remove bin/System.Data.SQLite.dll
* Open an FTP client and upload the files to the server
* Browse to the site, you should be automatically redirected to the on-line 
  installation page (otherwise the path is /n2/installation/)
* Follow the instructions in the wizard. It's also possible to export content 
  from your development environment and use it on step 4. in the wizard.
