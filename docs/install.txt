- Compile and run the application (Ctrl+F5)
- Browse to /n2/installation (use admin/changeme to log in)
- Follow the instructions on the installation page (also below)
	- Create an empty database in your server of choice. 
	- Update the connection string in web.config.
	- Update the database flavour attribute in the n2/database 
	  section.
	- If you can't use the web based installation interface you 
	  can find create database scripts on:
	  http://n2cms.com/Documentation/The database.aspx.
	- Now you need to insert the first node, I strongly recommend 
	  using the installation page to do this.
	- IMPORTANT! Change the default password in web.config. If 
	  you've installed, configured and created an administrator 
	  account using a membership provider, comment out this 
	  section entirely.
