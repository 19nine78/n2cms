Main solution (core + edit + templates):
- Download the code, obviously
- Set Templates/N2.Templates.UI as "StartUp Project"
- Compile and run (Ctrl+F5)
- If you get errors about database connection or see an install screen:
	- Either, download an sql express database and put in your wwwroot/app_data
	- Or, create a database manually and reference it from web.config

Examples:
- Run Prepare_Dependencies-vs2008.bat to copy core and edit to the examples
