- Run Prepare_Dependencies-vs2008.bat to copy certain files needed by the web project
- Open src\N2.Sources-vs2008.sln
- Set Templates/N2.Templates as "StartUp Project"
- Compile and run (Ctrl+F5)
- If you get errors about database connection or see an install screen:
	- Create a database manually and reference it from web.config
