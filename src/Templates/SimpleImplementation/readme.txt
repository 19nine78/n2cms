This is a simple starting project for the templates. The assumption is that 
you rather than chaning the templates themselves override or create new 
implementations in your own project. You can do as you like but this path 
might be easier if you plan to upgrade in the future.

The project needs a deploy of the templates dropped onto it in order to play.
