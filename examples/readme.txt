A few minimal implementations of N2 CMS.


HOW TO BUILD

In order to run the examples you'll need to update certain dependencien on N2 
core and edit. Running ..\Prepare_Dependencies-vs2008.bat should do it.

You are very welcome to let me know about your build experiences in the forum
so I can improve this document with commmon gotchas.
