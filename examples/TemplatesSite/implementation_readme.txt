This is a simple starting project for the templates. The assumption is that 
you rather than chaning the templates themselves override or create new 
implementations in your own project. You can do as you like. I've found that
doing changes in a project external to the templates made it easier to upgrade.

The project needs a deploy of the templates dropped onto it in order to play.
